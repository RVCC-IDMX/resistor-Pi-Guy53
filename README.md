# Resistor
The Resistor calculator (TRC) is a calculator used for determining the value, and operating parameters of a resistor.
Selecting the colors of the various bands will give you the Value, Ohmns, and tolerence of the resistor.
This is useful for when you have a resistor of unknown type/orign, and want to be able to use it.
